# SRRP

This is the master Git-Hub repository for the self-replicating robot project. Select one of the files (designs, docs, spreadsheets, code, etc.) and create a new branch to make changes or edits (add). Save your changes to that branch locally (commit) and request that your changes are added to the same named branch on the server (push). When all changes are made in the branch, you can submit a request for your work to be reviewed and merged back with the SRRP master repository to be deployed again for edits (pull request).

Git-Hub can be installed on Windows, Mac, or run through Linux commands (https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
